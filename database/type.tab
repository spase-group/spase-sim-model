1.0.0	1.0.0	Value	A description of the standardized measurement increments in which a value is specified. The description is represented as a mathematical phrase. Units should be represented by widely accepted representation. For example, units should conform to the International System of Units (SI) which is maintained by BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (see http://www.bipm.fr/ ) when appropriate or use tokens like "Re" to represent units of the Radius of the Earth. Within a phrase the circumflex (^) is used to indicate a power, a star (*) is used to indicate multiplication and a slash (/) division. When symbols are not separated by a mathematical operator, multiplication is assumed. Symbols for base units can be found at: http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/#symbols and those for common derived units can be found at: http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/derived_units/2-2-2.html

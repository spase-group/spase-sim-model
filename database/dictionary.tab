Within a phrase the circumflex (^) is used to indicate a power, a star (*) is used to indicate multiplication and a slash (/) division. When symbols are not separated by a mathematical operator, multiplication is assumed. Symbols for base units can be found at: <http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/#symbols> and those for common derived units can be found at: <http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/derived_units/2-2-2.html>

Two useful units which are not SI units are: degree (angle), and unitless (no units). An example is: "1.0E-5>T" which converts the units, presumable nT, to tesla. Another example is: "1.0e+3>m/s" which converts a velocity expressed in kilometers per second to meters per second.

<h1>The Data Model Presented Hierarchically</h1>
The taxonomy tree shows the inter-relationship of elements in the data model. 
This provides a "big picture" view of the SPASE data model. This taxonomy is implementation
neutral. Details for each element are contained in the data dictionary. 

Notes: Occurence specifications are enclosed in parenthesis: 0 = optional, 1 = required, * = zero or more, + = 1 or more

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
The Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) consortium
has defined a base information model for describing scientific
data and related resources. This document defines  
a set of extensions for describing the simulation models, runs
and the resulting data (numerical or display).

The SPASE Simulation Extensions were originally developed by the 
Integrated Medium for Planetary Exploration (IMPEx) project, 
a European Union (EU) Seventh Framework Programme sponsored project,
which was subsequently endorsed by the SPASE consortium.

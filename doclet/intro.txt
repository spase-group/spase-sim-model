<h1>Introduction</h1>
The SPASE (Space Physics Archive Search and Extract) Data Model is a set 
of terms and values along with the relationships between them that allow 
describing all the resources in a heliophysics data environment.  It is 
the result of many years of effort by an international collaboration 
(see http://spase-group.org) to unify and improve on existing Space and 
Solar Physics data models. The intent of this Data Model is to provide 
the means to describe resources, most importantly scientifically useful 
data products, in a uniform way so they may be easily registered, found, 
accessed, and used.

<h2>History of Development</h2>
The original implementation of the SPASE Simulation Extensions was developed 
by the EU FP7 IMPEx project (http://impex-fp7.oeaw.ac.at/). 
In 2014 the SPASE consortium endorsed and adopted the extensions as a part of the SPASE Data Model.

<h2>Resource Types</h2>
The top level entity in the SPASE data model is a Resource. There are 4 
different types of resources in the Simulation Extensions. 
These extensions can be used along side the resources found in the
SPASE Base Data Model. Each resource type consists of a set of attributes 
that characterize the resource. The Simulation Extensions are:

<dd>
	SimulationRun, 
<br>
	SimulationModel,
<br>
	NumericalOutput, and
<br>
	DisplayOutput
</dd>

The Simulation Extensions also override the Granule and Particle classes in the base SPASE schema.

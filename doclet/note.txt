<h1>Guidelines for Metadata Descriptions of Products</h1>
The following sections describe the details of the SPASE Simulation
Extensions to the Base Data Model. There is a richness in 
the available metadata that allows very detailed descriptions of 
products. While there are optional elements, please remember 
that the better data are described, the easier they will be to use.

To determine what level of detail that is needed, we recommend considering 
not only what the user needs to find the data, but also what is 
necessary to know if the data will be useful for the requestor’s purpose. 
The user might get this information by contacting you, but if the data 
were moved somewhere else and only the data description were available 
to determine the utility of the data, consider if the user would have sufficient 
information to know if this is the right data set and what problems 
might be associated with the use of these data. Also consider if 
additional documentation is necessary and if so create an Document
resource and associate it with the data resource.
An "Information URL" may also be used to provide links to more 
detailed information. 

In summary, products need not be described in minute detail, but users 
will need, at minimum, information for assessing what the data products 
represent and where to find them. Of course it is also useful to 
include information on how the data can be applied and common 
pitfalls in their use, but the first need is to make the products 
usefully visible.
